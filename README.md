## Server
The server can handle multiple clients.
It displays connect client names and number of clients connected, also the chats passing through the server.

## Client
Enter a name to join the chat.
The clients will display messages from all the connected clients.

I have handled all possible errors to prevent application from crashing.
This application do not have a GUI or any kind of encryption.
